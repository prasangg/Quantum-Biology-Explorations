    "# üåü Phase 1, Week 3: Entanglement & Bell States - The Spooky Connection! üåü\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare to have your mind stretched! This week, we're exploring one of the most profound and counter-intuitive phenomena in quantum mechanics: **Entanglement**. Often called \"spooky action at a distance\" by Einstein, entanglement describes a connection between quantum particles so deep that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary goals for this week's coding project are to:\n",
    "* **Code a Bell state simulator**\n",
    "* **Simulate correlation measurements** for these entangled states\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these simulations, we'll gain a practical understanding of:\n",
    "* **Entanglement** itself\n",
    "* The famous **EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paradox**, which highlights the non-local nature of entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ 1. Building Bell States: The Foundation of Entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell states are a set of four maximally entangled two-qubit states. They are the simplest examples of entanglement and are foundational in quantum information science. They look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$\n",
    "* $|\\Phi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle - |11\\rangle)$\n",
    "* $|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$\n",
    "* $|\\Psi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle - |10\\rangle)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To create these in QuTiP, we'll need to define a two-qubit system. This involves combining single-qubit basis states using the `tensor` product. A common way to create a Bell state (e.g., $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$) is to start with $|00\\rangle$, apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit, and then apply a CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate where the first qubit controls the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä 2. Measuring Correlations: The Proof of Entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of Bell states truly shines when you measure them. If you measure one qubit of an entangled pair, you instantly know the state of the other, even if it's light-years away! This perfect correlation is a hallmark of entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll simulate sequential measurements on both qubits of a Bell state to observe these correlations. For example, if you measure the first qubit of $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ and find it in $|0\\rangle$, you are guaranteed to find the second qubit also in $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà 3. Simulating Measurements on Entangled Qubits (Similar to Week 2, but now for two qubits!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like last week, QuTiP doesn't directly \"collapse\" the state for you after a measurement. Instead, we'll:\n",
    "1.  Define the projection operators for two-qubit states (e.g., $|00\\rangle\\langle 00|$, $|01\\rangle\\langle 01|$, etc.).\n",
    "2.  Calculate the probabilities of measuring each of the four possible two-qubit outcomes ($|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, $|11\\rangle$).\n",
    "3.  Use random sampling based on these probabilities to simulate multiple measurements and observe the correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to demonstrate the \"spooky action\" in action!"
